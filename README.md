# Computer Science Programming Projects

**Version 1.0.0**

This repository contains my current and on-going Computer Science Programming projects. My current projects fall under two main languages: Python and Java. Inside the Java Lab# folders is a folder named doc which contains the API documentation. Here is the project breakdown.
