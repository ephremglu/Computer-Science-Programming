# Computer Science Programming Projects

**Version 1.0.0**

This repository contains my current and on-going Computer Science Programming projects. My current projects fall under two main languages: Python and Java. Inside the Java Lab# folders is a folder named doc which contains the API documentation. Here is the project breakdown. 


### Python:

- [Bus Fare Calculator](https://github.com/ephremglu/Computer-Science-Programming/blob/main/Bus%20Fare%20Calculator.py)
- [List Traversal & Exception Handling](https://github.com/ephremglu/Computer-Science-Programming/blob/main/List%20Traversal%20%26%20Exception%20Handling.py)
- [Measurement Conversion Calculator](https://github.com/ephremglu/Computer-Science-Programming/blob/main/Measurement%20Conversion%20Calculator.py)
- [Median Number Finding](https://github.com/ephremglu/Computer-Science-Programming/blob/main/Median%20Number%20Finding.py)
- [The Euclidean Algorithim](https://github.com/ephremglu/Computer-Science-Programming/blob/main/The%20Euclidean%20Algorithim.py)
- [The Prime Number Calculator](https://github.com/ephremglu/Computer-Science-Programming/blob/main/Prime%20Number%20Calculator.py)
